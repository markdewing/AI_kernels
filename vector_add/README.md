# Vector Add

Adding two vectors is the "Hello, World" kernel.

It's useful for setting up the environment, ensuring it works, and measuring the bandwidth as a sanity check.

See the [vector_add](https://github.com/markdewing/qmc_kernels/tree/master/kernels/vector_add) kernel in the [qmc_kernels](https://github.com/markdewing/qmc_kernels/) repository for more languages and frameworks (most of them more HPC-focused)

The [data](data) directory has some data and graphs.
